# Image-Format-Converter
This Project This project converts the format of images from HEIC (the format that iOS is known to take pictures in) and converts it to JPEG 
and makes it available for download in zip format. The front-end is made using React JS and backend is made using Node and Express JS.

This project/webApp helps to solve issues of uploading assignment images on crowdmark. 

Crowdmark is a tool that The University of Winnipeg uses to evaluate the Math Assignments and Tests. The students submit the images of their work via crowdmark.
From a normal survey and observation it has been discovered that a lot of the students use Apple products so when they take pictures with their iPhone or iPad
and use AirDrop (the fastest and the most effecient way) to transfer them to Macbook, it has HEIC format which is the original format in which iOS and some other 
Android OS captures images in. So, when they upload those images in this application and click on convert and then download button they will have all those images
in Zip file which the users can open and then upload it to crowdmark on their own.

This project was mostly made for my personal use and with an objective to learn React JS. But seeing that it has the potential to help others on a greater scale,
I plan to edit this project to use cloud stoarge instead of static file-system so that others can use it as well.
